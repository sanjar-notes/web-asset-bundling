# 1. Motivation

Chunking (aka modularization) of software is an important concept used in software development.

It is especially important and problematic (or clumsy) to do for web apps, which consist of both code (JavaScript + style files) and non-code (images, audio, video) assets.

Understanding module and asset bundling is hence, key, to completely understanding web app development life cycle.

I wish to learn about the tools and concept used to bundle assets into more deployable pieces, in all kinds of web deployment - i.e. monolithic, per page etc.
